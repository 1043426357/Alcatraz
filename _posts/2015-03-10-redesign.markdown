## Redesign

It's been awhile since you heard from us the last time.
We've been busy at our jobs; Delisa moved on to Hello and shipped the amazing
[Sense](https://hello.is) sleep tracker.
I've moved to [Lyft](https://www.lyft.com) and didn't ship anything really.
Jurre is living #startuplife and merging in all your plugins. I don't know what
would we do without him!

This doesn't mean we've abandoned Alcatraz, we can just dedicate less time into it.

### Relaunch
As planned, we wanted to launch 2.0 with all the shiny features. In reality, we
can only do so much and have decided to release the UI part separately.
As of today, you can download the beautiful, redesigned version for OSX Yosemite
using the installation script on our [homepage](/).

The UI work done was a [mutual effort](https://github.com/supermarin/Alcatraz/pull/154)
by [many people](https://github.com/supermarin/Alcatraz/pull/205)
including @orta, @tonyarnold, @kattrali, and more.
Alcatraz doesn't look like a stranger in Yosemite anymore,
contains inline images previews, big install/remove buttons,
github attributions, and it's way more pleasant to use.

### Custom plugin list
You can now load a custom `packages.json` from a private source while developing
or using private plugins.

### Binary distribution
The plan is to move away from building source on your machines, and distribute
already built plugins. This will allow us to support CocoaPods, Carthage, Swift,
and other hipster features without the clients knowing about it.
It'll allow us to simplify the installer logic, and eventually move to Swift.
One other important feature is that it'll allow users to distribute commercial
plugins, or anything closed-source.

### Plugin stats
We've partnered with [Keen.io](https://keen.io) and got sponsorship for opening 
up the usage data. We plan to open up the data access to everyone,
so you can track your plugin usage in real time.
